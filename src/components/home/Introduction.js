        <h2>Hey There!</h2>
        <p>I am a server-side developer leveraging a Bachelor of Arts in English. I received my fullstack certificate from Georgia Tech, where I focused on Agile development in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React.js, and Node. Driven by a desire to develop apps that bring the perfect blend of joy and convenience, I love developing new products. As a result, I bring that love into everything I produce. My strengths include creativity, teamwork, and sticking with projects all the way from ideation to execution. Feel free to look around or send me a message any time.</p>
